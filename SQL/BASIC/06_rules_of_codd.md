# Rules of EF Codd

## Table

- A Table is nothing but combinations or crossection of rows and columns.
- Columns can also be called as "attributes".
- A part of table or block of table is also called as cell.

## Rules of EF Codd

1. Data stored in a cell must be single valued data, i.e -> 1 cell = 1 value.

2. In RDBMS we only store everthing in form to tables.
- Including Meta data.
- Details about data = meta data.

3. According to EF Codd we can store data in multiple tables & whenever connection between two tables by using key attributes.

4. We can validate data inserted into tables by 2 steps.

    - step 1) by assigning the datatypes.
    - step 2) by assigning the constraints.

    * Assigning datatype is mandatory but the assigning constraints is not.
